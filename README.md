# 🤖 AutoApply AI

A small personal project exploring job application automation using Python, Selenium, and basic AI concepts.

The goal of this project is to better understand how web automation, text similarity, and AI-assisted content generation can work together in a real-world scenario.

## 💡 Project Overview
AutoApply AI is an experimental automation script that helps simulate parts of the job application process.

Instead of blindly submitting applications, the project focuses on:
- analyzing job descriptions,
- comparing them with a resume,
- and generating a simple, customized cover letter.

This project was built as a learning exercise and is not intended to be used at scale.

## 🚀 What It Does
- **Web Automation:** Uses Selenium to navigate job pages and simulate user interactions.
- **Basic Matching Logic:** Computes a similarity score between a resume and a job description using vector-based methods.
- **Cover Letter Generation:** Automatically drafts a tailored cover letter based on job requirements.
- **Local Storage:** Keeps track of applied jobs using an SQLite database to avoid duplicates.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Automation:** Selenium
- **Database:** SQLite, SQLAlchemy
- **Math / Vectors:** NumPy

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to structure a small automation project
- Basics of web scraping and browser automation
- Introductory concepts in text similarity and AI-assisted generation
- Using a database to manage application state
